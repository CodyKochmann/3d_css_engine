v 0.8
Everything that posed itself as a problem one week ago has been solved. With the buildings rendering themselves in their own unique ways, this keeps the project within the time scope that was originally expected. 

v 0.7
Added multi-threading support to handle the building database and the rendering of the map in the background because the size of the project was beginning to push the limits of a single process. Also took the project out of the development folder and into a NodeJS database in prepration for it being put into Amazon's cloud service.

v 0.6
Added support to building database generator for injectable code to increase development speed of buildings and to reduce the size of the building files since some were exceeding 500-600 lines of code for each building.

v 0.5
Began development of the automatic building algorythm to make it so only a few designs need to be developed which can be bent and molded into hundreds of unique designs.

v 0.4
Added better support for a large-scale city and rendering. Fixed the building coordinate generator. Increased the city to a 20 by 20 tile grid to start building on the scale that the demo will be run at.

v 0.3
Sketched up 5 sample building designs. Coded the first two house designs. Made a prototype of the grass generator and tree generator. 

v 0.2
Completed the building string parser which allows entire building design to be saved in one string for faster loadtime than angularjs and easy management of the building database.

v 0.1
Off day. Mocked up the design for the building database and string parser. Then outlined a development plan for the week.
